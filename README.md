## Key Features

- **Catamaran Design**: The catamaran-inspired design with PVC hulls ensures stability and buoyancy on the water surface.
- **Debris Collection System**: A modular debris collection system is implemented to effectively collect and store floating debris.
- **Dual Operation Modes**:
  - **Remote Control Mode**: Users can navigate the USV via Bluetooth using the Dabble app.
  - **Autonomous Mode**: Onboard cameras and Python-based computer vision algorithms enable real-time debris detection and navigation.
- **Propulsion and Control**: Integrated DC motors and an ESP32 microcontroller provide propulsion and control for the USV.

## Objectives

- Achieve buoyancy and propulsion on the water surface with and without debris in the storage.
- Implement an effective waste collector mechanism for collecting and storing floating debris.
- Establish remote control connectivity between the user controller and the USV.
- Implement object detection and tracking algorithms for autonomous operation.

## Potential Impact

This versatile solution, adaptable to various environmental conditions, promises significant advancements in debris collection efficiency and environmental conservation efforts. It heralds a new era in sustainable water management practices, contributing to cleaner and healthier water bodies.
